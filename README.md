## Project Overview

**Frontend Quiz App** is a web application that allows users to solve quizzes in various frontend categories like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Accessibility.  
After the initial version built with Vanilla JS, this React-based version offers a more modular, manageable, and user-friendly experience through its component-based architecture.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Question Categories
- On the welcome screen, users can select from category options such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Accessibility**.
- Each category loads questions from different JSON data files dynamically.

### Theme Toggle (Dark/Light)
- Users can switch between light and dark modes.
- The selected theme is stored in `localStorage` and remains persistent even after page reloads.

### Instant Feedback, Animations & Result Screen
- The app instantly shows whether the selected answer is **correct or incorrect**.

- When the user selects the **wrong answer**, the choice visually shakes using a `shake` animation.  
- The **correct answer** is highlighted with a `pulse` animation (scaling up and down) for emphasis.
This enhances user interaction and visual clarity.

- At the end of the quiz, the total number of correct answers is displayed with visual feedback.

- Additionally, when the result screen appears, a **celebration confetti animation** begins using the `react-confetti` library 🎉  
This confetti continues **until the user returns to the main screen**.

- Categories, questions, choices, and the result screen are each handled in separate components.
- State management and event handling are implemented in a clean and effective way.
